# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment and CI/CD processes.

## Supabase Migrations Workflow

The `supabase-migrations.yml` workflow automatically deploys database migrations and edge functions to Supabase when code is pushed to the main branch.

### Setup Requirements

To use this workflow, you need to configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

1. **SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN**: Your Supabase access token
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens
   - Generate a new access token
   - Add it to your repository secrets

2. **SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF**: Your Supabase project reference ID
   - Found in your Supabase dashboard URL: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/{PROJECT_REF}`
   - Or in your project settings

3. **SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD**: Your Supabase database password
   - Found in your Supabase project settings under Database > Connection string

### How to Add Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Add each secret with the exact names listed above

### What the Workflow Does

1. **Triggers**: Runs on pushes to main branch that affect:
   - `supabase/migrations/**` files
   - The workflow file itself

2. **Steps**:
   - Sets up Node.js environment
   - Installs Supabase CLI
   - Logs in to Supabase using access token
   - Links to your Supabase project
   - Deploys database migrations
   - Verifies migration deployment
   - Deploys edge functions (if any exist)
   - Provides deployment summary

### Manual Trigger

You can also manually trigger this workflow:
1. Go to "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Select "Supabase Migrations" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select the branch and click "Run workflow"

### Troubleshooting

- **Authentication errors**: Verify your `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` is correct and not expired
- **Project linking errors**: Check that `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` matches your project ID
- **Database connection errors**: Ensure `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` is correct
- **Migration conflicts**: Check that your local migrations are up to date with the remote database

### Security Notes

- Never commit secrets directly to your repository
- Use GitHub's built-in secret management
- Rotate your Supabase access token regularly
- Consider using environment-specific secrets for staging/production
